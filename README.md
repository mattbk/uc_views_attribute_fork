# uc_views_fork
Fork of the Drupal module [uc_views](https://www.drupal.org/project/uc_views) for displaying attributes in Views.

I am not the original creator or maintaner of uc_views at Drupal.org.  I can't guarantee any support of this fork in the future, so use at your own risk.

Some history for clarity:

`2011-10-19:` [miiimooo](https://www.drupal.org/u/miiimooo) created a [patch](https://www.drupal.org/node/908944#comment-5135048) for uc_views:
> Attached is a patch to port uc_views_attribute partly to drupal 7. So far I've implemented and tested uc_views_attribute_handler_field_order_product_attribute (Fields -> add -> Ubercart order product: Product attributes). This field displays any selected options on a particular order.

> Notes for testers: I've removed the dependency of uc_views_attribute on uc_views. It works standalone now. The rest of uc_views will still show up in the module list as incompatible with d7. Maybe I should open a new project but there may be reasons for it staying in uc_views.

`2013-02-06:` I shared a [patched version](https://www.drupal.org/node/908944#comment-7033968) of uc_views.  As far as I know, this is what I started with for the current repository.

`2015-10-04:`  I picked up this project again in hopes of getting individual attributes to show up as fields in Views 3 for D7.
